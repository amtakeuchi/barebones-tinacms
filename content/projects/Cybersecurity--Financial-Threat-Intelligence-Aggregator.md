  Project Overview


  This is a custom-built Flask web application I designed to scrape and collect
  the latest headlines and alerts from across the cybersecurity, finance,
  cryptocurrency, geopolitics, crime, and world news ecosystems. It serves as a
  centralized dashboard for monitoring breaking news, active cyber threats,
  financial market movements, and geopolitical events relevant to incident
  response, penetration testing, cloud infrastructure security, and strategic
  risk monitoring.


  Reason being? Well, as someone diving deeper into cybersecurity operations and
  cloud infrastructure security, I kept running into the same issue: information
  overload and wasted time. Between dozens of RSS feeds, industry blogs, and
  sites like Bloomberg removing their RSS endpoints, staying current on relevant
  threats, incidents, and financial trends was becoming a chore and a drain with
  all the jumping around. I needed a way to cut through the noise and surface
  the most actionable, security-relevant headlines — fast.


  So, I built it myself.


  The Idea


  I wanted a personal dashboard that could pull news and alerts from multiple
  trusted sources — cybersecurity sites, financial publications, crime
  bulletins, and world news — then filter them by keywords relevant to my daily
  work as an incident responder, pentester, cloud engineer, and sysadmin. Think
  APT alerts, ransomware incidents, critical vulnerabilities, market-moving
  crypto crime stories, and geopolitical conflicts with cyber risk implications.


  This Flask web app combines:


  The result is a clean, lightweight web dashboard that shows me the latest
  threat intelligence and financial risk signals in near real-time, tailored
  specifically for what I do.


  Why This Matters


  In cybersecurity, timing is everything. Getting a zero-day disclosure,
  nation-state attribution, or critical infrastructure ransomware report even 30
  minutes before your competitors can make all the difference in patching,
  escalation, or response prep. This tool helps me stay a step ahead without the
  noise.


  Plus, integrating finance and world news lets me track how macro events might
  ripple into the cloud and enterprise tech spaces. A geopolitical conflict in a
  region hosting major data centers? A regulatory crackdown on a crypto
  exchange? This dashboard catches it.


  What’s Next


  Somewhere down the line I’m planning to enhance it with:


  It’s already become a core part of my workflow, and one of the most useful
  personal tools I’ve built so far.
