# About Me

Hey! Nice to meet you. My name is Adam, and this is my personal website. I use it to share the projects I've been working on, talk about events, trends, and issues in the cybersecurity/IT landscape, and share what's going on in my mind through blog posts.

## What I Actually Do

I'm an IT professional who specializes in cybersecurity, particularly in the Cloud, SOC, and penetration testing fields. What sets me apart? I bridge gaps. Having worked alongside (and learned from) everyone from developers to executives to janitors, I understand that not all threats are virtual. The soft skills I've honed let me translate tech into action, and action into results. Because at the end of the day, cybersecurity isn't just about systems; it's about people.

But the thing is, I didn't start out dreaming in code. I got into this because I was curious, stubborn, and apparently enjoy mild torture in the form of troubleshooting complex technical problems at 2 AM.

## My Professional Background

I hold a diploma (Associate's Degree for anyone viewing this from the US) in Cyber Defence and Cloud Administration from the Manitoba Institute of Trades & Technology, where I graduated with a 3.8 GPA and a 5th place finish in the Skills Manitoba IT Competition.

### Certifications
- CompTIA Security+
- TryHackMe SOC Analyst Level 1
- Amazon Web Services Cloud Essentials
- Fortinet Certified Associate Cybersecurity

My experience spans from hands-on client support and security incident response to developing web solutions that drive user engagement. I've successfully managed high-volume technical support scenarios, authored comprehensive incident response plans, assisted with forensic investigations, and delivered security solutions that protect client systems while maintaining operational efficiency.

## The Skills I've Picked Up Along The Way

### Security Operations & Analysis
- SOC analysis (Splunk, Wazuh, ELK Stack)
- Incident response and forensics
- Network analysis (Wireshark, Zeek)
- Threat intelligence and malware analysis
- MITRE ATT&CK framework

### Infrastructure & Cloud
- AWS and Microsoft Azure administration
- Windows Server and Active Directory
- VMware vSphere and ESXi
- Cisco networking
- FortiGate firewalls and VPN

### Development & Automation
- Python programming
- Web development
- Linux administration
- Network automation
- Data visualization (R, Tableau)

### Professional Skills
- Project management
- Technical writing
- Customer service and support
- Crisis management
- Business acumen and risk management

## Why I Do This

Money. HAHAHA nah I'm kidding, every field pays well enough if you perform better than everyone else. There are a couple of real reasons why I do this:

- Everyone needs it
- Not everyone can do it
- I enjoy the challenge and problem solving aspects of it

Every problem is different, requiring a unique solution, and there's something really satisfying about taking something not so great and making it work better than before.

I've learned that creation isn't about flawless execution; it's about being willing to try something, holding on and adapting when things inevitably go wrong, and having the resolve to see things through. It's the same as the gym, it's the same as learning new skills, it's the same as romance: do your best, use the best intentions, know that things go wrong and that it's okay, and what some would consider "failure" is actually a success (failure is only failure when you quit on something that could have been successful).

## What's Next

I'm always working on something new, learning something I didn't know yesterday, and am always up for the next challenge. Whether building a website (like this one), securing a cloud network, or crafting a new tool to crack a system open, I'm here for it.

I'm eager to dive into cybersecurity and join the battle against threat actors, whether it's working with cloud environments, hunting down threats in a SOC team, breaking (then fixing) systems as a pentester, or responding to incidents while under pressure. If your team needs a junior professional who is hungry to learn and even hungrier to improve, let's talk.
