Very late in doing this, but I’ve been busy and better late than never.

I was invited by a good friend to speak at an event at Red River College Polytechnic. The Bits and Bytes Association was hosting a Cybersecurity night, and he asked if I'd come talk. I agreed, partially as a favour to him, partially to better myself, and partially because I wanted to give the people coming up next the information I wished someone had given me when I was in their place.

When I was still in school, I can’t remember a single person who presented that actually gave useful advice for myself and where I was at, or that actually seemed interesting and like they wanted to be there helping us out. It frustrated me to no end, because it felt like I was just wasting time attending and listening, and because of that, I wanted to give these students the best talk they’d ever attend and receive. 

On September 26, 2025, I was given the privilege of speaking first to the crowd of hopeful knowledge seekers. I delivered a talk packed with resources, hard-won lessons, and the edge-giving tips recruiters would never hand out. I spoke on my own experiences with school and finding a job, how hard the job market actually was, what was required to get employment, how to effectively network, and what things would actually pay off for them in terms of certifications, projects, and learning.

A good majority took to the information like a sponge, absorbing all they could. I saw people engrossed in the presentation, never looking away or scribbling furiously to jot down notes. I had people asking questions all throughout - about my slides, about thoughts on the industry, about things that popped into their heads or that they'd read somewhere else. Nobody interrupted, nobody left, and people shushed others if one started speaking at all.

But after everyone else had spoken, I was floored by just how much the information I'd shared resonated with everyone there.

I was flooded with people wanting to ask more questions, wanting to know how I got "so good at presentations", wanting to connect with me on LinkedIn and ask about networking opportunities, wanting to get one more tidbit that could potentially help them in the future. I stayed an extra 30 minutes after the event ended just talking with a group of these bright and fresh minds, new to the field but excited to try. I gave out book list recommendations, skill advice and how to practice certain things, information on my past and how I got into cybersecurity, and a whole bunch more things I'm probably forgetting right now.

Today is December 2nd, 2025. I've received interest from a couple other places and plan on going to speak more. I still want to help more people. I still want to provide more growth triggers to the community and improve the cybersecurity field in Winnipeg, and the rest of the world. I still want to see people who deserve to succeed, succeed.

I decided to write this post today because I received a text from one of my friends who knows someone who attended the talk I gave at RRC, and that person said that I was his favourite speaker.

My talks will continue. For everyone hungry enough to want more, driven enough to act on it, and deserving enough to make it.
